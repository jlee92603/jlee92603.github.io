## About Me

Jihye is Babo.

### Favorite Color

My favorite color is red. But also black and white and navy blue. However, despite liking these colors, sometimes their color combination is not always the best. Black and red give me dark and dangerous vibes. People tell me, when I wear my red and white striped shirt, I look like Where's Waldo. Do you get what I mean? And when I wear all these colors together, I remind myself of the Korean flag haha.

### Favorite Music

I absolutely love Kpop. I especially into solo artists right now. I love Zico, GD, IU, Jung YongHwa, as well as groups such as EXO, Day6, and Blackpink, but I like StrayKids, Seventeen, and so much more. The only thing I feel like slightly regretful towards Kpop is that I didn't discover it sooner. I feel like, even though I'm Korean, I never noticed the existance of Kpop. Like, I would hear Kpop in something my mom is watching or some Kpop songs would reach the Americas, but I didn't realize it was Kpop. Songs like Gangnam Style, I knew they were speaking Korean, but I just thought it was an American song for some weird reason. 

### Hobbies

I love making music. I would record myself as I play different instruments, I would make music arrangements, and I would even make music covers on music editing software. I also love dancing, singing, and making music videos, so I would follow Kpop dance moves and make MVs out of them. Recently I found a new hobby. I like coding. It's really weird because I've never liked it before. My dad, being a passionate computer engineer, wants his kids to learn programming. No one, out of the 4 kids, wanted to learn. He bought books on Python, he made lesson plans, and even gave lots of resources for us. But NO ONE, including me, wanted to learn. However, over the summer, my dad hired a private Python tutor for my younger siblings. I hate not be better than my siblings at anything so I enrolled too. After learning for a while, I found it fun. I liked solving puzzles and challenges with Python (btw, I love nonograms and solitaire and other puzzles). Hence, I even changed my major. I was going to pursure biomed, but now, I'm like "Hm... why not incorporate programming?" so I changed to Biomedical Engineering.

### My Favorite Animal

My favorite animal is bear. But not the real bear. I like the cartoon bear. Real bears are kind of ugly, but cartoon bears are cute. 

### Biggest Worry In Life

My biggest worry in life is my youngest brother. He is too smart that it's scary. I guess since he's the youngest child, he had to be smart in order to play boardgames and cardgames with us. Additionally, since all his older siblings are smart and talented, I guess we kind of pressured him into being talented and smart. Now, he has already learned high school geometry by the time he finished 6th grade. It's hard to argue with him because he can make decent counterarguments. And he is big on questioning everything, which is so scary. He would ask "Why does a glass cup break and a plastic cup doesn't?" or "Why is egg protein instead of meat?" or "Why do some humans have blue eyes? Did human ancestors (chimps) also have blue eyes? Why not?". And I would try to use my AP science knowledge to answer them, but, like, I've never questioned life like this before and I don't think people usually do. My younger brother has been like this since a young age, and I think it runs in the family because my older brother would ask my dad stuff about stuff and they would go into this deep, philosophical science or political conversation where I cannot understand anything. Bottom line is, I am so scared at what kind of genius my younger brother is. I just hope that he'll give me some money when he becomes a rich genius. 

### My Favorite Sibling

My favorite sibling is my younger sister. Period. She's always there for me and I loooove annoying her. Sometimes I feel bad for being such a bad older sister. When I have bad dreams or stomach cramps at night, she would wake up for me and calm me down. If she had a bad dream, I would just tell her to shut up and go to sleep. If I do something bad, she doesn't tattle on me. But I do with no hesitation. Wait... I'm feeling even more guilty as I write this so I'll stop here. 

### My Burial 

When I die, I want to be buried just like this: 
- Make me into ashes
- Sprinkle 1/5 of my ashes on the tallest place on earth, 1/5 on the deepest place on earth, 1/5 on the coldest place on earth, and 1/5 on the hottest place on earth. 
- And then feed the last 1/5 to a polar bear in the arctic.
