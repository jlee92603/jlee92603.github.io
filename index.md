## About Me

Jihye. 

### Favorite Color

My favorite color is red. 

### Hobbies

I love making music. I love playing the different instruments (oboe, drum, piano) and making music arrangements, and creating music covers on music editing software. I also love dancing, singing, and making music videos. Recently I found a new hobby: coding. It's fun. I also like sewing and watching Kdramas and eating and bears and card games and Genshin Impact. 

### My Favorite Animal

My favorite animal is bear. But not the real bear. I like the cartoon bear. Real bears are kind of ugly, but cartoon bears are cute. 

### My Burial 

When I die, I want to be buried just like this: 
- Make me into ashes
- Sprinkle 1/5 of my ashes on the tallest place on earth, 1/5 on the deepest place on earth, 1/5 on the coldest place on earth, and 1/5 on the hottest place on earth. 
- And then feed the last 1/5 to a polar bear in the arctic.
